harmonica-tunner
================

A web app to display which note is played in a harmonica.

It'd be great if also this could recorder in someway the sound played, then save it like a jsfiddle file and then shared to friends. This'd need a db, we can use mongolabs. 
Also is needed that a tab is recorded to be shared. In the future this could be a partiture.
